    Three views are going to be inherited here if we go with a button click.
    we can place buttons in sales, products and customer in order to export/import.
    the inherit will go only in the form view and two actions will be added, one ex one im.
    this is considered to be the easy part.
    if we need a cron to be scheduled then also we will have a new xml file which will contain the 
    cron defined with the action from the corresponding email.
